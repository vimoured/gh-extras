# gh-extras

GitHub pull requests from Vim, through [gh](https://cli.github.com): list the
open ones and check one out, look back through the merged ones, read and answer their review threads, and post
[fugitive-extras](https://github.com/roumail/fugitive-extras)' review
comments as a pending review. Built on [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive); to
review a branch's diffs, see
[fugitive-extras](https://github.com/roumail/fugitive-extras).

## Open and merged pull requests

`:PRs [count]` lists the repo's open pull requests, most recently updated first
(default 20, at most 100), in a window at the bottom, under a line of column headings:
number, who opened it, title, branch, review state (`draft`, `approved`,
`changes`, `review`, or `-`) and age.

Who opened it is their login, or a readable name for it from a file of
`name:login` lines (`Mira:mira-dev`, logins in any case), read on each refresh.
Lines starting with `#` are skipped.

```vim
let g:gh_extras_pr_authors = '~/.config/gh-pr-authors.txt'  " the default
```

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `<CR>` | `gh pr checkout` the PR and close the list, saying `Checked out #7 (:BranchDiff, :BranchCommits to review)`: those fugitive-extras commands review it. |
| `/` | Filter the list as you type (see below). |
| `t` | Its review threads, as `:Thread` (see below). |
| `o` | Open the PR in the browser. |
| `r` | Refresh. The cursor stays on its PR. |
| `q` | Close (`:q` too). |

`:MergedPRs [count]` is the same list for merged pull requests, most
recently merged first (default 50, at most 100), to
look up what was done and why. Its last two columns are the merge commit
(the squash commit, for a squash merge) and how long ago it was merged.
`/`, `t`, `o`, `r` and `q` are as in `:PRs`; `<CR>` opens the merge commit in
fugitive, in the window above, instead of checking the PR out. The commit
must be fetched. The PRs come from the most recently updated merged ones, so
one merged long ago but commented on since can be among them.

Defined only when [gh](https://cli.github.com) is installed.

### Filtering with `/`

`/` filters a list as you type, fuzzily, as fzf does, in `:PRs` and
`:MergedPRs` and in the thread lists (see below); its keys are
[vim-lists](https://github.com/roumail/vim-lists)', the same in every list.
PRs match on who, title and branch, best match first; threads on their file,
their PR's number, branch and title, and who wrote in them, and stay in file
order.

## Review comments

With [fugitive-extras](https://github.com/roumail/fugitive-extras) installed,
its review comments post to the pull request. Checking a PR out from `:PRs` with unsaved
comments warns once; `:CommentsSubmit` warns too.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `:CommentsSubmit [number]` | Post the comments as one **pending** review of `HEAD` on the branch's PR, or PR `number`, through `gh api`. Only you see it until you submit it on GitHub. Refused while any comment's lines are gone (`W` in `:Comments`, see fugitive-extras' anchors). Defined only when `gh` is installed. |

The review is of the commit you read: `HEAD`, so check the PR out (`:PRs`,
`<CR>`) to review it. If the author pushes more before you submit, the
comments stay on that commit, as on GitHub. Comments on a file changed since
`HEAD` are refused, since their lines aren't its; commit or stash first. When
`HEAD` isn't in the PR (unpushed, or rebased), the review is of the PR's head
instead, if the commented files are the same there, else it is refused.
Comments on lines outside the PR's diff (more than 3 lines from a change, as
GitHub shows it), or on a range across two of its hunks, are named and the
review is not sent, since GitHub rejects the whole review for one of them.

## Review threads

`:Thread [number]` lists the review threads on the branch's PR, or PR
`number`, with their conversations, in a window at the bottom, so you can
read and answer replies to your comments without the GitHub UI. Each thread
is one line: its file and line (`a.py:18-20`), its state, how many comments it
has and the start of the last one, so `j`/`k` go from thread to thread. `=`
opens a thread to its conversation, each comment's author, age and text, and
closes it again, as fugitive's `=` does a file's diff. Opened threads, and
`u`, stay as they were on `r` and when the list is opened again. A thread on
a whole file shows its path without a line (*not yet*: it shows as
`outdated`). `pending` marks a comment of a review you haven't submitted,
which only you see. The heading counts the open threads and those that are **your
turn**: open, with someone else's comment last. Resolved threads are hidden
until `u`.

`:Threads` is the same list for the threads you're in across the repo's open
PRs: those with a comment of yours, and every thread on a PR you opened. Each
PR's threads are under a line with its number, branch and title.

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `<CR>` | Open the file at the thread's line (a whole file's thread at its top), in the window above: from the work tree when the PR is the branch checked out, else as of the PR's last commit. An **outdated** thread (its lines changed since) opens the file as of the commit it was made on. Commits must be fetched. |
| `=` | Open the thread to its conversation, or close it to one line. |
| `x` | Resolve the thread, or unresolve a resolved one. |
| `u` | Show or hide resolved threads. |
| `o` | Open the thread's PR in the browser. |
| `/` | Filter the list as you type (see [Filtering](#filtering-with-)). |
| `r` | Refresh. The cursor stays on its thread. |
| `q` | Close (`:q` too). |

### Replying

Replies are written as [fugitive-extras](https://github.com/roumail/fugitive-extras)'
comments and [vim-prompts](https://github.com/roumail/vim-prompts)' asks are:
on the command line, or in a draft when they are longer. In a thread list, on
a thread's line:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `:Reply [text]` | Post `text` as a reply to the thread; prompts unless it is given, and an empty reply posts nothing. Leaving the prompt with `<Esc>` keeps what you typed: `:Reply` or `:ReplyDraft` on the same thread goes on from it. |
| `:ReplyDraft [text]` | Write the reply in a markdown buffer of 10 lines above the list, starting with `text` if given, else with what you left at the `:Reply` prompt on that thread. A [vim-draft](https://github.com/roumail/vim-draft) draft: `:w` saves it, closing it (`:wq`, or `:q` after `:w`) posts what was last saved, and an empty one or `:q!` before any `:w` posts nothing. |

If posting fails, the reply's text is in the unnamed register. While you have
a pending review on the PR, GitHub adds the reply to it instead, and says so.

To take a reply you're typing to a draft, change `Reply` to `ReplyDraft` on
the command line (`<C-b>` goes to its start) and press Enter. Two `<Plug>`
mappings bind them to keys, the same as fugitive-extras' comment keys, say:
`<Plug>(gh-extras-reply)` leaves `:Reply ` on the command line to finish, and
`<Plug>(gh-extras-reply-draft)` is `:ReplyDraft`.

```vim
autocmd BufEnter gh-extras://thread* nmap <buffer> <leader>cc <Plug>(gh-extras-reply)
autocmd BufEnter gh-extras://thread* nmap <buffer> <leader>cd <Plug>(gh-extras-reply-draft)
```

The first 100 threads of a PR are shown, with the first 100 comments of each;
`:Threads` looks at the 50 most recently updated open PRs, and the first 50
comments of a thread. Threads are the conversations on the diff's lines and
files; the PR's own conversation is a key away, in the browser (`o`). Defined
only when `gh` is installed.

*Not yet* marks a known bug: [vim-suite](https://github.com/vimoured/vim-suite)
asserts the behaviour described (its `test/known-failures.txt`), and the note
goes once it's fixed.

## Install

Its commands need [gh](https://cli.github.com), installed and logged in;
they're defined when it is. Outside a git work tree, in a repo without a
remote, or when gh or git fails, they say so and do nothing. The core is gh-extras and two plugins:

- [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): finds the
  repository and runs git.
- [vim-lists](https://github.com/roumail/vim-lists): the lists every command
  opens.

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'roumail/vim-lists'
Plug 'vimoured/gh-extras'
```

That gives you `:PRs`, `:MergedPRs`, `:Thread`, `:Threads` and `:Reply`.

Each row below adds a module on top of the core, and **Needs** is the whole
set of plugins it takes besides the core; without them, the command says
which it needs:

| Needs | Module | Adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [vim-draft](https://github.com/roumail/vim-draft) | Drafts | `:ReplyDraft`, a reply written in a vim-draft draft |
| [fugitive-extras](https://github.com/roumail/fugitive-extras) + [vim-place](https://github.com/roumail/vim-place) | Your review on GitHub | `:CommentsSubmit`, fugitive-extras' review comments as a pending review; checking a PR out from `:PRs` warns of unsaved comments |
| fugitive-extras + vim-place + [vim-review](https://github.com/roumail/vim-review) | A saved review on GitHub | `:CommentsLoad` a review saved earlier, then `:CommentsSubmit` it |

All of it:

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'roumail/vim-lists'
Plug 'roumail/vim-place'
Plug 'roumail/vim-draft'
Plug 'roumail/vim-review'
Plug 'roumail/fugitive-extras'
Plug 'vimoured/gh-extras'
```

## Tests

Tested by [vim-suite](https://github.com/vimoured/vim-suite), in
`test/gh-extras.vim`, with the dotfiles that use it. Every pull request runs
them.
